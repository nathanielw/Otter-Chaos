# Complete and Otter Chaos in a World of Fanta Seas

Simple web-based game made as part of a mini hackathon / [coding extravaganza](http://arcton.nz/64hace/winter-17.html).

Made to fit the themes "chaos" and "fantasy".

Created over a couple of days, so may be lacking in polish / not make a whole lot of sense :)

Built using the Phaser framework, with the base project generated using [generator-phaser-plus](https://github.com/rblopes/generator-phaser-plus).
